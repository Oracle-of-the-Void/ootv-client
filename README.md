After Legend of the Five Rings was sold to Fantasy Flight at the end of 2015, Don Eisele (Author of the Oracle of the Void) has continued to fund and run the Oracle of the Void.  He is currently working on revamping and coding the Oracle into a serverless cloud architecture on AWS.  The new version will be faster, more resiliant (not running in Don's basement), and support other games.
